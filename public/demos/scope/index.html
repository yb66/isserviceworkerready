<h1>Managing multiple scopes</h1>
<p>
  This page registers 3 sevice workers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>./sw.js default-scoped to ./</li>
  <li>./app-a/sw.js default-scoped to ./app-a/</li>
  <li>./app-b-sw.js scoped to ./app-b (note the lack of trailing slash)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Usually these would be registered by each individual app, but I've done it all
  on this page so they're all registered by the time you visit the following pages.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./">./ (this page)</a></li>
  <li><a href="app-a/">app-a/</a></li>
  <li><a href="app-a">app-a</a></li>
  <li><a href="app-b">app-b</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each service worker logs when it intercepts a fetch, use "preserve log" in the console
  to see them all.
</p>
<h2>What you should see:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Navigations to this page are intercepted by ./sw.js.</li>
  <li>Navigations to app-a/ are intercepted by app-a/sw.js.</li>
  <li>Navigations to app-a are intercepted by ./sw.js, the server redirects to app-a/ which is intercepted by app-a/sw.js.</li>
  <li>Navigations to app-b are intercepted by ./app-b-sw.js, the server redirects to app-b/ which is also intercepted by ./app-b-sw.js.</li>
</ul>
